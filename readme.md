# Project: Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow

A music streaming company, Sparkify, has decided that it is time to introduce more automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines and come to the conclusion that the best tool to achieve this is Apache Airflow.

They have decided to bring you into the project and expect you to create high grade data pipelines that are dynamic and built from reusable tasks, can be monitored, and allow easy backfills. They have also noted that the data quality plays a big part when analyses are executed on top the data warehouse and want to run tests against their datasets after the ETL steps have been executed to catch any discrepancies in the datasets.

The source data resides in S3 and needs to be processed in Sparkify's data warehouse in Amazon Redshift. The source datasets consist of JSON logs that tell about user activity in the application and JSON metadata about the songs the users listen to.

## Project Description

This project on data pipeline was made using AWS REDSHIFT (like Postgres) defining fact and dimension tables (star schema) , and has an ETL pipeline using Python to transfers data from S3 Bucket to Redshift.

## Files

### Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.

>song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json


Below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```
This dataset was distributed into songs table and artist table.

### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```
Below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

This dataset was distributed into time, users, and songs_play table.

## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) - Star Schema

![REDSHIFT_ERD](https://github.com/sandramalaquias/data-engineering-Redshift/blob/4184288175034ba8a580a25b533a4ed289c9caf5/REDSHIFT_ERD.png)

 **Benefits of the Star Schema**

-   It is extremely simple to understand and build.
-   No need for complex joins when querying data.
-   Accessing data is faster (because the engine doesnâ€™t have to join various tables to generate results).
-   Simpler to derive business insights.
-   Works well with certain tools for analytics, in particular, with OLAP systems that can create OLAP cubes from data stored.

## About Apache Airflow

Airflow has an official Dockerfile and Docker image published in DockerHub as a convenience package for installation. You can extend and customize the image according to your requirements and use it in your own deployments.

This project is using  <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/docs/docker-stack/">Apache Airflow - Docker - version [v2.3.3]</a> 

## Load scripts folders into Airflow

Put the dags folder in Airflow dags. At scripts, all imports follow this distribuition and all of scripts will be used.

## Configure the AWS connections

1. Launch AWS Redshift Cluster
	  Follow the instruction <a href="https://github.com/sandramalaquias/data-engineering-Redshift/blob/master/README.md#run-the-scripts/">Launch Redshift using Boto3</a> steps: 1, 2 and 3.
	  
     Get cluster endpoint that was showed on terminal, example: {'Address': 'dwhcluster.xxxxxxxxx.us-west-2.redshift.amazonaws.com'
   
2. In Airflow, create AWS Redshift connection
	Choose Admin > Connection -> + (add a new record):
	>	
		- Connection Id: "udt_credentials"
		- Connection Type: choose "Amazon Web Service"
		- Description: "credentials to aws udadity"
		- Host: "dwhcluster.xxxxxxxxx.us-west-2.redshift.amazonaws.com" (your redshift endpoint)
		- Login: "dwuser" (db user)
		- Password: "xxxx" (your db user password)
		- Port: 5439
	If you follow the script mentioned above to launch AWS Redshift Cluster , Login and Password are in dwh.cfg in fields: "dwh_db_user" and "dwh_db_password".

3. In Airflow, create AWS connection
	Choose -> Admin > Connection -> + (add a new record) using:
	>	
		- Connection Id: "udt_credetnials"
		- Connection Type: choose "Amazon Web Service"
		- Description: "credentials to aws udadity"
		- Login: your AWS access key
		- Password: your AWS secret key 
		- 
4. When the project finished, disable your AWS resources.  Follow <a href="https://github.com/sandramalaquias/data-engineering-Redshift/blob/master/README.md#aws-desconnect/">Disable AWS resources with Boto3</a>
		
## Configure the airflow variables
Insert the variables used in this project.
Choose -> Admin > Variable -> + (add a new record):
>
	1 . Key: "s3_udacity"
		Val: "udacity-dend"
		Description: "s3 udacity bucket name" 

	2.	Key: "s3_log"
		Val: "log_data"
		Description: "log data contain user login and songs that the users listened at period that they had been login
		
	3. Key: "s3_song"
		Val: "song_data"
		Description: "songs and artists detail available on the app"

## Run DAG
In the Airflow UI DAG, start "udacity_project5". This DAG will be running automatically. The Graph for this dag will be:

<a href="https://ibb.co/KDZ2Dw6"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/68hH8BY/udacity-project5-Graph-Airflor.png" alt="udacity-project5-Graph-Airflor" border="0"></a>

This DAG is in "udacity.py".

## The environment:
All the environment are in Airflow docker image .

## Operators description
All of the operators and task instances will run SQL statements against the Redshift database. However, using parameters wisely will allow to build flexible, reusable, and configurable operators that can later apply to many kinds of data pipelines with Redshift and with other databases.

### Stage Operator
##### stage_redshift.py

The stage operator is expected to be able to load any JSON formatted files from S3 to Amazon Redshift. The operator creates and runs a SQL COPY statement based on the parameters provided. The operator's parameters should specify where in S3 the file is loaded and what is the target table.

### Fact and Dimension Operators
##### Load_dimension.py  and  load_fact.py

With dimension and fact operators, utilize the provided SQL helper class to run data transformations. Most of the logic is within the SQL transformations and the operator is expected to take as input a SQL statement and target database on which to run the query against. 

### Data Quality Operator
##### data_quality.py

With data quality operator, which is used to run checks on the data itself. The operator's main functionality is to receive one or more SQL based test cases along with the expected results and execute the tests. For each test, the result and expected result needs to be checked and if there is no match, the operator should raise an exception and the task should retry and fail eventually.

##### HasRows Operator - has_rows.py

This operator, works like a quality check and verify if exists rows in table, and get raise an exception if no records was found.

## Helpers description

### Sql Create Tables - sql_create_tables.py  
In that script description is the class SqlCreateTables, that contain  the SQL needed to create all of tables. In CREATE statements have the clause "IF NOT EXISTS" and due that, is possible to run the DAG without issues. If need to include more tables in the DAG, just update this script.

### Sql Queries - sql_queries.py
In that script is the class SqlQueries, that contain  the SQL needed load the dimension tables. and the SQL for quality purpose.

## Data Analytics  
Using this ERD and their tables, is an easier way to create queries to answer single questions to analytics issues or make more advanced topics like predict user churn or music recommendation.
